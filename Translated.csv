1347,truly inspiring video the presentation is truly flawless and the few frames of minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game i love how you used pocket edition because its unique and different than most minecraft videos being published today using pc or console versions of the game and i really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles i really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding if you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay we can find that the player is holding a torch just like the many around his shelter this means the torches around the base has just been placed and shows how you can move forward in life no matter how dire the situation may seem in the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning showing how even if someone is in their home they are never safe of the dangers outside and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety i also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls not to mention the way the player looks out the exit as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there and how even though you may be small compared to the universe the impact you make can change the world another very symbolic part of this film is the ending where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the players dedication it also is in a slightly smaller frame and black bars replace the outer edges which show that even though you try your best there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey and how much different it could have been if you have done something different which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of minecraft as long as possible without itching ones testicles the background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt blue or sad about ending but still proud of what they accomplished and is hopeful for what is to come a really poetic performance really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls i cant wait to see more work from you 1010 simply phenomenal,positive,True

1352,i have ptsd and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts it is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened you keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with ptsd arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation i guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts the idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in ptsd you still keep dwelling on it years later,negative,True

4476,i did my undergrad in computer science and im finishing up my ms in computer engineering it always drives me nuts when people ask what i do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering i try to explain it like this computer science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems computer engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems i always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took computerelectrical engineering as undergrads because they generally speaking are simply trying to make x thing work and i am trying to make x thing run as efficient as possible you can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines anyone looking at going to school for computer science should understand this you are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary anyone can learn to code but being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career if you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code you will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks but those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use i hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,negative,True

4606,ive been an edtech consultant in beijing for 7 years ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools there are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive the first and foremost factor i would note is the lack of public discourse this permeates through every part of society especially education if you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection in education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember the second factor of note is barriers of information the public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it on top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as vipkids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations this causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name eg wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it the third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge as stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection if youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies how can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences the result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content the fourth factor is lack of foreign talent there are not enough qualified teachers to meet demand the general population would not be able to recognize one either many companies hire russians call them american and slap a 200 markup on the course its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents the final factor is who the decision makers are who decides what national curriculum is starting in 2020 private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum this topdown decision making only exasperates the situation it also permeates throughout the society ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best i should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program as for price its simply about demand vs supply lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost they will pay upwards of 200k rmb just to make it happen for their little middle schooler unfortunately i exited the market partially because the clients i had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum,negative,True

5675,some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative,True

6037,i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch 22 i feel like your video alluded to what i mean by democratization quite well so i think were probably in agreement there a lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models i think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and bigquery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away this opens ml models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and mlops we still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day for experience i really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people this is where i think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience the largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you i would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level my expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at 02 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5 years of experience so while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program together i think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals if workers with domain experience but not a ds education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job i think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree,positive,True

6225,some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative,True

10127,i think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself in your death bed every now and then to prepare yourself for this you must read the 9th chapter of the death of ivan ilyich again just a very short chapter where ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed he suddenly hears the voice of his own soul saying what do you want what do you want he says what do i want to live and not to suffer so his inner voice says to live how to live as i used to well and pleasantly as you lived before well and pleasantly here is how tolstoy continues and in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant life but strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant life now seemed at all what they had then seemed none of them except the first recollections of childhood there in childhood there had been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live if it could return but the child who had experienced that happiness existed no longer it was like a reminiscence of somebody else as soon as the period began which had produced the present ivan ilyich all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned into something trivial and often nasty so as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and darker he basically realises that his entire life had been a lie he lived for what the others expected from him for money power and statushe wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no way back indeed we all must keep ivan ilyich in mind every day just consider how fast the time goes by how much of it do we really spend seriously thinking about our lives very little indeed because it requires a certain level of focus and depth which we dont have most of the time thats why this scene is a great reminder so as we make the death bed exercise i have just mentioned we can use the very questions that ivan ilyichs soul was asking him i think people who live well deal with their mortality better so doing this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better thank you for this wonderful lesson i love tolstoy,neutral,True

10167,i would also like to point out that actually understanding machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics as was mentioned as a benefit being part of something will be extremely difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability statistics in fact at my university in order to enrol in the first machine learning course you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus with proofs as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops one or two courses in linear algebra and 2 courses in statistics that’s not to say it’s impossible to use ml without that of course it isn’t however it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge much more so than with required programming knowledge for ml so yes you will be “a part of something” in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with but it’s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ml publications at a meaningful level or be generating their own custom models,neutral,True

10468,imo whats most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly theyre hoping to get out of these deals everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money but then what i have to wonder is if gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios then why wouldnt they turn down ps in theory gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties weve also seen plenty of evidence that xbox is swimming in microsoft money so they should easily have the means to outbid sony for games they want on their service as well as typical console exclusives for that matter yet we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to sonys deals and stipulations if a studio wanted to join gp and told sony they would decline their gp restriction contract i can see them getting less marketing on ps but i highly doubt sony wouldnt want their sales cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with sony but i dont know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line it just seems to me like somehow many studios arent jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it that or gp isnt as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think no shade at gp i love it just saying i dont get how ms would be losing out to sonys contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place,positive,True

11108,my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,negative,True

12524,my theory here that plant creature could possibly be that fungus but in a more mutated form as seen previously in the missing persons and autopsy report videos whenever someone dies in the backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus this fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate 100 1000 or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the informational video with the date 291990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel that researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the presentation video with the date 581990 when the alarm rang out and cctv footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by async so by this logic the whenever someone dies in the backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time the creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash as seen in kanes secret video of 9780415263573 this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage the driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there the fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form also it sounded like the creature was yelling out help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver its all just a theory which i just came up with dont take it canon lol,negative,True

I am still calculating with new Airpods or Airpods Pro, what happens to the Apple TV I also calculate from a new old ""HomePod"" I am currently not interested in the new watch. Battery limps and Apple Next year with the 4 model the software tap will finally turn this will go because many still have the 4 model and have been waiting for the angular design for a year but one is clearly not a tight design no new Apple Watch then the 4 has to survive for me for a year somehow",neutral,False

13625,thanks for the great content shane as a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing i have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route if you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot while traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth you end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge coming from an engineering discipline myself i was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways i have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route i say this because i have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through they definitely can break through and thrive in this field they offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route so if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as nlp if you are someone who comes from a stem field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems all data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science but what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model i dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but i do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,positive,True

14009,i found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty,positive,True

14577,im taking a few online ml tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and i have to say that it is very similar to what i did in econometric with regards to predicting the regression analysis in ml is the same as i did in econometric but i just i didnt use python to do it i was using stata but you could use r to do the same thing and now days im sure they are teaching python in economics at any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ml course i still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful albeit i do recognize that ml is a large topic and the first part of learning ml that i am doing including the textbook all start off doing regression analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ml and the other parts i have yet to get to like ai and neural networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about idk i often hear people say that ml is used for large datasets like at netflix google amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines well thats all fine and good but i dont work at a company like netflix or google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill the other problem is that to use ml at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ml course that it is very complicated and wont go into thus kind of making the example of these fang companies almost useless in the short term and medium term when you learn about ml you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line technically you could use excel to reproduce some of the things i have learned in ml so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating or other things in ml like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car you can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes 70k will they buy a car it will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not the problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes and real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc so it becomes hard to do your own projects in ml because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects most of the time the ml tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using they just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset this is a huge issue if you want to try doing ml on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc im often left wondering how the ml regression analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter for example in my book they talk about using ml to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 57 factors but to be honest the housing sample is a great example but i often have trouble trying to think of a problem that i could create using ml to predict a result ie my own project also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be i dont even need data or run ml on it to know that it can get demotiving at times so the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true like predicting gas prices will be higher in the summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter its 200 pages like that countless hours of videos from tutorials saying now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea i am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ml and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what i want im tempted to skip 20 hours or 200 pages ahead and dive into the neural networks but cant stop thinking that maybe regression analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way will be helpful in the ai section or whatever so far its like learning basic statistics but in python,neutral,True

15714,yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making 2d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make 2d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to 3d games by learning 3d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with 3d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already,negative,True

15725,this lecture is awesome and really inspiring ive been a fan now for years now lex and im really happy to see your success i just wanted to point out that i believe your analysis of one shot learning re human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base the learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling sitting up and standing up this process takes usually between 1 and 2 years this time and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible the process can be accelerated through coordinationspecific training on the part of the parents which occurs quite often errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road eg requiring knee replacement at 55 bipedalism is pretty complex and is way harder than quadrupedalism which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim,positive,True

16545,so a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere but the question is is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger or is the tree happy when it’s small too the obvious answer is no the tree doesn’t care another answer would be “we have no way of knowing” people like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection people assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly this happens all the time so even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now what we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are i don’t think trees know this concept i think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants in fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it the trees definitely don’t need it either,negative,True

16869,10308 since we are talking about mines i wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines now i understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines which i love because they leave a large impact on the world but it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often that is why i thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future there could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is far later into development you could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts the way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks a major issue with this though is how the camera system would work i could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however i feel like that might not fit the game i wouldnt have an issue with it but others may of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldnt work when trying to make mineshafts i think edit i guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground another thing i thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground i say that as if it is easy when i actually know hardly anything about game development but i do believe that should be achievable but going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldnt which i think would be cool of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse,neutral,True

17452,first of all let me clear up the misunderstanding about why asians do well in life we do not always send kids off to academic supplements sat study classes etc obviously there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go but there are a plethora that do just as well if not better on these types of activities sat act gpa school etc without any additional help aside from a practise test book from the local library that is me and i can affirm that for many asian kids we have an inherent need to do good make our parents proud no matter how much pressure we have and have a highlevel job and go to ivy league schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us we push for the best because of our work ethic not because all asians have oh so much money for the majority of our parents as immigrants it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour the hard work the exhaustion and the prejudice they have faced in the past all to provide their children with more opportunities it is not that asians are inherently smarter or richer or more privileged in any ways although there are those select few but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today asians are no different from others of ethnic origin to say mexicans africanamericans indians and other disprivileged minorities in the states the only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end i am not trying to start up any racial slurs cursing or insultations of any kind just putting out a thought and consideration for you all obviously there are many successful talented and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones but i am just making a point here why would the highlevel universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of racial preference or racial advantage note i put that in quotations meaning i myself do not think that is a fact there are hardworking and lazy people smart and ignorant good and bad in any race it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public so tell me why should one race get more sympathy or preference over another can we not just all be equal human beings it is like saying red is better than pink why oh because it is true without an explanation so what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade chinese girl and i wanted to share the truth to everyone thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully we can all start changing society little by little with messages like this no enmities i hope,positive,True
